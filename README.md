# Introduction to Algorithm
An algorithm is a well-defined (studied) computational procedure. This repo contains 
coding exercises of algorithms discussed in the 
book [Introduction to Algorithm](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844).
Review of this book used in Master program back in BU.

Most of the programs are done in python and C++. 

The folders are organized according to the sections of the book.

## Parallel computing
Some algorithms can be done in parallel. A good example is [merge sort](./ParallelComputing/MergeSort.py). A list can be splited into two. Use two threads to sort them, and then merge the final result.
